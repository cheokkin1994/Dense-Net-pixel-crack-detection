# Dense-Net-pixel-crack-detection

The DenseNet implementation is based on the https://github.com/seasonyc/densenet for the DenseNet implementation, except the classfication layer is a multi-label sigmod layer.
The preprocessing file process the AigleRN dataset (Amhaz et al., 2016), Retrieved from https://www.irit.fr/âˆ¼Sylvie.Chambon/AigleRN.html. 
The network should be used as a structured prediction of crack images.
